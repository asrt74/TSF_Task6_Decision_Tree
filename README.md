# TSF_Task6_Decision_Tree
## Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
### The task is to create a Decision Tree classifier and represent it graphically
### The purpose is to train the model so that it can predict the class of new data correctly
Given "Iris" dataset has 4 variables as PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm, SepalLengthCm & SepalWidthCm and the corresponding species it belongs to.

This is how the algorithm takes decisions to put data with features to a specific class of species
